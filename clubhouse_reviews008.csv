"I was happy to see CH come out for Android, and have been enjoying the content, learning how to work the app, etc. My biggest issue is that when I try to send an invite it doesn't show up for the person I'm inviting. It tries to change my text app to FB Messenger, and then the message just disappears, and I lose the right to send it again. The reminders seem to help as I've been able to send those. I think this forum has real potential, but the problem with invites is discouraging.",Positive,1
"The app was great on android, but the past several months it has become virtually unusable. When connected to my Bluetooth headphones (Powerbeats Pro), my voice cannot be heard by anyone else in the call. Several others and I have submitted tickets to support, along with room recordings for examples of the issue, but this issue has not been addressed. I'm on the latest Android and CH versions on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra, but this issue has been consistent with many other android/Samsung users",Positive,1

"Bad news first, this app actually limits the amount of messages you can send to people you want to support and connect to and that's a huge turn off. It limits your opportunities of connecting with a real person especially if it's inconvenient for you to talk in a room with them. Otherwise good unique app with the right amount of something special I see in it",Positive,0
"This used to be a great app. The last few weeks after a recent update, it had been the worst audio experience possible. The audio is choppy and cuts in and out and when it does connect the volume is low even on the highest setting. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and no difference. Will reconsider rating if things get fixed, but there doesn't seem to be concern for Android users experience.",Negative,0
"I can't hear anything! My volume is way high. I can sometimes listen in on one room but all others are in complete silence. I uninstall then reinstall app and sometimes this works and I can hear conversations and other times it doesn't work. Yes I have full signal. Not sure what's happening hear, positive it's not on my end. It's been like this since I learned about this app, over a year now.",Positive,0
The app was great for a few days. Suddenly I can't hear the speakers. The mic icon doesn't even show. I've been booted out of rooms without cause (it wasn't the mods). I've done all of the suggested troubleshooting including deleting and reinstalling the app and nothing has worked. We'll have to find a different app without issues.,Positive,0
It's a good app and a way for people to discuss interesting topics. I've been on it for a week and it freezes sometimes and I can't enter in. Also I think they should add more features. Where room leads and moderators can set up lines for people to talk. Or icons where people can communicate on there picture. It's annoying when 30 people start to speak all at once. Some rooms are controlled than others but there needs to be some tools to help order.,Positive,1
"It's 2021, not 2011! Any app that is on ios should have automatically been available on Android. It should not have taken 6 months to get it on Android and then when we finally do we get this garbage! I downloaded the app and then I have to wait for a text message for my account to set up? It's already been almost 12hrs! Still waiting! Never had an issue with any other app to just get an account. I gave it a try, but forget it. Goodbye!",Positive,0
"App was working fine until it wasn't. Really great App for professionals to learn and participate in important industry conversations. I have been on for about a week then the app crashed, scheduled a few rooms that I am interested in but can no longer join them. I have re-installed the app a couple of times but to no avail still getting the error message ""Error, please try again later"". I feel like a kid outside a locked candy store.",Positive,1
"As a blind man, I don't care for your room window as a small window and other clubs in another. It would be nice to have an option for one window when you're in or managing a room. The mute button is way too small, too, and not easy to find if you have big fingers. Also, when a phone call comes through, you should make it where the app just mutes the conversation so it doesn't bleed in or confuse a person when they're trying to talk on the phone. Put an alert dialog on screen when notices come.",Negative,0
"Its a great way to connect and find friends. Unfortunately has a few bugs at the moment, please fix the back channel bug where it opens the last massage every time you open the app. Second on androids, if you take a call whilst in a room, you cat take a phone call because the voices mix .",Positive,0
"When I go to saved replays an error message appears, Also the application doesn't show up the rooms that someone speaks in it. Also in the search nothing from the old saved rooms appears. I already uninstalled and reinstalled the application but nothing solved.",Positive,0
This app needs way to many updates and i really wanted to give it a better review. But now with the recent changes I cannot share an active room to social media anymore nor do I have an option of replays. It dosent show up at all. Very frustrating. Please fix the issues I have reached out already and got no real help,Positive,0
"Hi, I like it. The reason of rating 4-star is that I can't see the event calendar anymore which was useful for me. I know scheduled rooms will be added to Google Calendar but having one in the app is good, too. If it's still available, please guide me.",Positive,2
"The application has become rude, and it has rudeness in the modifications. I hope to activate the feature of blocking the platform of some houses. I do not want to see their rooms. The hiding feature is very bad üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé",Negative,-3
"In the last update, everything is worse. Everything is nightmare!!! I can't even see the recorded rooms in people's profile!!! Block system is more trash than ever!!! Also changing clubs to houses is the worst decision! What is happening to Clubhouse???",Negative,-1
"Extremely aggressive people and mysoginists. There are no intelligent or even entertaining conversations. It's all gossip subjects from other countries that I can't relate to or even understand, extreme rage, and woman bashing. Not a place for me. I tried hiding the conversations that weren't to my taste but it kept bringing the same 4 up over and over and over again. It also kept signing me into conversations that I was trying to remove. This is a bad app. Dont waste your time.",Negative,0
"I cannot access my saved replays anymore. Also when u search someone or go to someone's profile which u even follow, the list of rooms, in which the person was a speaker in doesn't show up anymore.",Neutral,0
"It's a wonderful app get to know in lockdown period, and as of now, in 2023, I have been using it for more than 2 years üòÄ got to know so many people new friends and i got new projects like dubbing voice over so happy to be a Clubhouse user and singing is my passion and soon it wil be professional becoz of this application üòÄ",Positive,2

"I am using this app for learning. And it was so useful until I logged out one day then now I cannot log in to my account since I get this message. ""Our systems have detected high usage of this feature from your account. Please try again later."" Could please give me th hint to solve the problem?",Positive,0
"I rarely rate apps, but just wanted to praise their superb customer service. I reported a bug, and ...bang! two days later there was an update to resolve the issue! Thank you Clubhouse!",Positive,2
A beautiful app. I hope Android users can also have music mode soon when connecting to mixers. It's April 2023; android users don't have music mode but the app has improved a lot. I love clubhouse and I am increasing my rating to 5 Star ‚≠ê,Positive,3
Clubhouse needs an update. The explorer portion at the top of the page is off-centered. Other than that the app is fine. Works the same as on iOS.,Positive,0
App is funüôÇI'm on app all day but now this horrible update doesn't let you enter a room even if the event is current. It says sorry event has ended. Please fix this glitch error and I will change review to 5 üåü thanks üôèüèΩ,Negative,-1
"The black and white photo in night theme showed with reversed color. There is a problem in ""hide member list"". When list member hided , a problem occured in ""schedule event"". It is disabling public room to enable replay. If ""how can join"" be in ""open to all"", it is occured therefore ""hide member"" would be disable permanently to enable ""replay"". There is a problem to show replayed room in new version.",Negative,0
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it !(UX LAW) _ Latest update has totally made the app unusable! Such a worst UX update! You guys are unbelievable dumbos. What was the need for new house when you had amazing ROOMS feature?? u could have added new features to previous room itself!What if house has 10 schedules and user want to create new topic? and the new creation button is hidden somewhere inside A small box? that's a real bad. Only way to add MODS is making them ADMINS of the house ?üòûBad RESEARCH",Negative,0
Replays doesn't work on samsung phone!!! I have tried on iPhone and it's working fine. Need to fix this problem as soon as possible please!,Positive,1
My replays are not visible on my page or anyone's page. People can see my replays but I can't see there's. I reported this issue prior and still no update or correction. Please help!,Neutral,0
The app is a very good one. But what doesn't make sense to me is how CH informs House owners about the Users who reported their houses or rooms for having inappropriate/instigating/triggering topics. This doesn't make sense by any standard and this puts a target on the whistle-blower.,Positive,2
"Too many notifications!! There needs to be a way to shut off all notifications EXCEPT the ones I want. The way it is now, we have to allow all or none. üëéüëé",Positive,3
Replays are no longer working you can click on the actual clubhouse to go and listen to replace or the replays that you have saved and click on the tab it keeps coming up error try again,Neutral,0
"Are you guys expecting Nasa's internet speed from a user, Even after having a nice internet connectivity the voice often keeps lagging and breaking. Unlike other apps you literally olny had one thing to work on, thats better voice experience but you stil seem to be failing in that.",Positive,1
"I have the account but i can't login again, saying invalid or detached! I'm receiving the call but not the code. I can't lose this account so please fix it",Neutral,0
Are you improving or making the medium unusable? It has gone from a position where it could have been used casually to a position of why it should be used,Negative,-2
App has lots of bugs. Can't change phone number or email id. The app is not stable. The profile page is flickering. Fix all the bugs.,Neutral,0
This app is superb for solo travellers ... And people who love socialising with a distance ..... Only thing which I felt missing is the option to delete sent msgs...... Unlike watsap here you don't get an option to delete sent msgs permanently from the chat history.... This feature is very much needed which is what I felt... We have an option of archived msgs which is a temporary delet or hidden option ... Which again reflects when the person sends you a msg again..hoping to get this fixed soon,Positive,1
"so much nsfw content out there, even without any follow or like such kind of things are visible on home screen. i transitioned from reddit talks but club house is completely different with full unhealthy and 18+ content. Even after using hide feature they appear again, very poor moderation by creators. I hope reddit talk will be back ü§û",Positive,0
"I love your platform, but everytime I update the app, something is wrong. Today I can't have access to rooms' replays. Disappointed üòî",Negative,-1
pretty good app but it should try to add more features like allowing play a different time zone should be updated to different people like an African Europe,Positive,1
"After the newest update, the app makes a notification sound every time someone enters the room I am in. It is very annoying. Imagine being a room with over 100 people don't and the notification bell goes off constantly. I don't follow any if these people, why am I getting a notification sound every 60 seconds? I have the notification turned off within the app and through system notifications for the app.",Negative,0
There was an update and now there are issues with viewing the replays....error message when trying to view replays,Neutral,0
"Hi Google play and clubhouse company , I will send this issue with email too but in here I say it , recent update is very very bad for android users because we can't refresh the room for new change pics or seats of persons , specially for users like me that run games like mafia needs to refresh the room many times for see the seats , so please release a new update to fix that !! Thanks üëçüèª",Positive,0
"Good as an audio platform. I think it‚Äôs the best app against boring facebook. But there have some issues need to solve. When someone join as a speaker, if his microphone is on but no sounds makes for first time. But when he leave the room and join again then it‚Äôs seems normal. Maybe, it‚Äôs a bug. I hope the Clubhouse team will solve this issue early.",Positive,0

"Please please please, back in Iran, there has not been a single day that we have not experienced clubhouse without Bug. Specially after updates, once the messages does not show and No notification comes. Another time Pin button stop working, the other day changing people in rooms does not show and we have to refresh every second to undressed who is inside the room and who has left.

"I'm having a horrible experience with the audio. I'm also having a huge issue with trying to submit a report through the normal means. Whenever I'm pulled on stage, for some reason the audio starts to come through my phone speaker instead of my Bluetooth headphones. I have looked at the permissions needed and have them activated but for some reason the audio still is played through my phone speaker instead of my headphones.",Negative,0
"Interesting concept. A lot of audio problems. No adjustable volume which means one person is barely audible while the other blows your ears off. When I am ""on stage"" the audio changes to phone call quality, with the same volume issues.",Positive,0

Love the new house features.",Positive,2
"Too many notifications with the latest update. There should be a better way to choose what notifications you would like to receive.

"If you have an Android, this app wasn't made for you. Apple devices are prioritized when it comes to updates and functionality. Also, your account can be suspended through mass reporting. Clubhouse will not tell you what you did or supply evidence of any violations.",Neutral,0
"I've had it for 2 weeks now. So far almost EVERY room I've gone in, they are all talking about things that are COMPLETELY off topic. A few have even admitted that they will put clickbait titles for the topic, just to get people to go into their room, but had no intention of actually discussing that topic. It's extremely annoying for those of us who actually want to engage. Lot of ignorant conversations going on as well. The people just give me a a bad impression of the app as a whole.",Negative,0
Can't access replays. Several glitches since the forced switch from clubs to houses.,Negative,0
"As far as social media apps go, clubhouse is great for people like me. It'll be an easy 5 star if the sound didn't get choppy when I use my earpiece. Works well enough on my Bluetooth earphones, but gets the occasional chops on the wired one. For now, 3 stars",Positive,0
Unable to invite anybody it is not showing my list of followers. I wish there will be a block option in the launch as well. Blockers can also enter inside the launch,Negative,-2
